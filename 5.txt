Competitive trade-offs that may arise in fast-food restaurant include price vs. quality and cost vs. customer service. (If we have too few cashiers, customer waiting time will increase and subsequently service level will decrease. On other hand, if we have too many cashiers, server idle time will increase, which in turn will result in unnecessarily high labor costs and lower productivity.)
